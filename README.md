# Surf and Shake Shop Project


## Project Overview

While on vacation in Hawaii last year, I discovered a newfound passion for surfing. I've been trying to create a plan that will let me not just return to Hawaii, but live there forever. AndI finally came up with a foolproof idea: a Surf and Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists.

The investors backing the project are concerned about the weather. They are requiring further analysis to decide whether the project issustainable year-round, so it is necessary to assess temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, the investors want temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.


## Results

Temperatures in june and in december in Oahu are slightly different, even though June is mostly spring season while december is mostly automn. This phenomena is expected, as Hawaii is located closer to the equator than Mexico and the US.

The following histograms show the difference in temperatures over the period from 2010 to 2017:

Statistics summary are presented below:

Key differences:
* Mean temperature in june is higher than it is on December by almost 4째.
* Minimum temperature recorded on December is 8째 lower than the minimum temperature recorded on June.
* Dispersion of temperature is higher on December than on June; the interquartile range in June is 4째 while in December, it is 5째.


## Summary

Given that there is not such a great difference in temperature between June and December, it could be assumed that the Surs and Shake Shop would be sustainable year-round.

However, it would be best to analyze deeper:
* The behaviour of rainfall may affect the client flow;
* The climate change may affect both temperature and rainfall.

In order to solve this inquiries, it would be necessary to perform the exact same analysis on precipitation and add another analysis over the trend of both climate variables (temperature and precipitation) over the course of time. It may be advisable to include a larger dataset in this anlysis.
